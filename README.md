## About
Welcome, I'm happy you're here ✨ I am an MSc in Finance from [Bocconi](https://www.unibocconi.it/en) / [SSE](https://www.hhs.se/), who taught myself programming in my free time and I really like it. Currently I'm working in a bank doing STIR quant dev / trading, and I also really like that, feel free to dive into some of my work, currently living in Stockholm 🇸🇪
